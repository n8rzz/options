### Delta

An estimate of how much an option contract price will rise given a one dollar increase in the underlying stock.

This value will be positive for call options and negative for put options.  A call will increase in value as the underlying stock goes up and a put will decrease in value. Conversely, a put will increase and a call will decrease in value when the underlying stock decreases in price.

### Gamma

Rate of change in delta for every one dollar rise of the underlying

### Theta

Theta is a measure of the time decay of an option, the dollar amount an option will lose each day due to the passage of time. For at-the-money options, theta increases as an option approaches the expiration date. For in- and out-of-the-money options, theta decreases as an option approaches expiration.
