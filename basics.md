**An estimate of how much an option contract price will rise given a one dollar increase in the underlying stock.**

This value will be positive for call options and negative for put options.  A call will increase in value as the underlying stock goes up and a put will decrease in value. Conversely, a put will increase and a call will decrease in value when the underlying stock decreases in price.
